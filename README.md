# Feed Reader Testing Application

To run application:

1. Open index.html within a browser

2. If the application loads sucessfully rss feeds and links will appear

3. To see if the unit tests have sucessfully passed go to the end of the page and you will see a grey secion labeled Jasmine. There you can see how many specs have been written and how many failures have accured. In addition you will see what tests were performed for the app.

Enjoy.
